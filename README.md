# Analyzing-Income-Levels-by-PUMAs
The purpose of this research is to calculate the correlation between educational involvement and average personal income in each of the fifty-five Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA) of New York City, which are based on the location of New York City’s fifty nine community districts. Our research seeks to answer the question: does a strong correlation exist between education and income levels? With respect to real world applications, we are attempting to interpret the importance of education as it relates to one’s socioeconomic place within society. Our chosen data sets will enable us to study rates within a single year (2019). Each of our datasets connect to each other in that educational involvement can be mapped to crime rates, crime rates can be mapped to unemployment, and unemployment can be mapped to personal income levels (response variable y). Income levels, unemployment rates, and attendance rates are continuous; crime counts and enrollment in academic institutions are discrete; and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) is nominal. Units of analysis in our research are dollar amounts (income levels), percentages (of the labor force, of days), and total number (of offenses, of students).
